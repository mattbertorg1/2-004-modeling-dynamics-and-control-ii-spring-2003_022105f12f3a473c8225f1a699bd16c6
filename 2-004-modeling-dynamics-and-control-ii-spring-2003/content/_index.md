This course is the second subject of a two-term sequence on modeling, analysis and control of dynamic systems. Topics covered include:

*   kinematics and dynamics of mechanical systems, including rigid bodies in plane motion
*   linear and angular momentum principles
*   impact and collision problems
*   linearization about equilibrium
*   free and forced vibrations
*   sensors and actuators
*   control of mechanical systems
*   integral and derivative action, lead and lag compensators
*   root-locus design methods
*   frequency-domain design methods
*   applications to case-studies of multi-domain systems
